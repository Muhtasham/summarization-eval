# Context-based (Reference-Free) Evakuation for Abstractive Summaries

## Overview
This project develops methods for evaluating text summarizations without relying on reference summaries. It focuses on intrinsic qualities of the summaries, assessing them through custom metrics, as well as metrics from literature including large language models.

## Features
- **GPT-based Evaluation**: Leveraging GPT models for qualitative assessments.
- **Adapted ROUGE & BERTScore**: Traditional metrics reimagined for reference-free contexts.
- **Custom Metrics**: Including word overlap and Jaccard similarity for content analysis.
- **Hallucination Detection**: Identifying hallucinated content in summaries.
